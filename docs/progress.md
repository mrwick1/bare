## Module 1: URL, DNS, TCP and HTTP

| #   | Topic                                                     | State   | Code                     |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| 1   | URLs                                                      | done    | `crates/url/`            |
| 2   | DNS                                                       | done    | `crates/net/src/dns.rs`  |
| 3   | TCP: time limits, Happy Eyeballs                          | done    | `crates/net/src/tcp.rs`  |
| 4   | HTTP/1.1 messages: requests, responses, where a body ends | done    | `crates/net/src/http.rs` |
| 5   | Connections: keep-alive                                   | done    | `crates/net/src/http.rs` |
| 6   | Redirects, status codes, caching                          | done    | `crates/net/src/http.rs` |

What each done topic covers:

- URLs: the WHATWG URL Standard for `http://`. Relative links, IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, percent-encoding, and Unicode host names (UTS #46 with NFC, bidi and joiner rules, Punycode).
- DNS: `localhost`, `/etc/hosts`, a TTL cache, A and AAAA queries over UDP with a TCP fallback, alias (CNAME) chains, and checks against fake answers.
- TCP: Happy Eyeballs (IPv6 first, a new try every 250 ms, the first connection wins). Time limits: 10 seconds for one connection try, 30 seconds for a read or write.
- HTTP/1.1 messages: a status line and headers parser. Three rules for where a body ends: chunked, `Content-Length`, or connection close. Chunked wins over `Content-Length`. A short body is an error. 1xx, 204 and 304 have no body.
- Connections: keep-alive. The `Client` keeps one idle connection for each server and reuses it. It drops a connection that is idle for more than 15 seconds, that the server closed, or that has extra bytes after a reply. A reused connection that fails is retried once on a new one (safe for GET only).
- Redirects, status codes, caching: `Client::get` follows 301, 302, 303, 307 and 308 (at most 20) and returns any status, so a 404 page is shown. A redirect to `https://` gives an error. The in-memory cache uses `max-age` and `Age`, honours `no-store` and `no-cache`, and revalidates a stale copy with `If-None-Match` and `If-Modified-Since` (a 304 reuses the copy).

## Module 2: HTML tokenizer and DOM tree

| #   | Topic                                                | State   | Code                            |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1   | Bytes to text: encoding, newlines                    | done    | `crates/html/src/encoding.rs`   |
| 2   | Character references (the entity table)              | done    | `crates/html/src/charref.rs`    |
| 3   | Tokenizer (state machine, raw text)                  | next    |                                 |
| 4   | DOM tree (arena)                                     | planned |                                 |
| 5   | Tree builder (implied tags, void elements), app      | planned |                                 |

What each done topic covers:

- Bytes to text: BOM, then the `Content-Type` charset, then a `<meta charset>` in the first 1024 bytes, then a guess (UTF-8 if valid, else windows-1252). UTF-8 and windows-1252 (also for latin1 and iso-8859-1). `\r\n` and `\r` become `\n`.
- Character references: all 2231 names from the WHATWG list (generated into `crates/html/src/entities.rs`), decimal and hex numbers, the old names without `;`, the stricter rule in attribute values, and the fixes for 0, surrogates, numbers that are too big, and `&#128;` to `&#159;` (windows-1252).

## Known gaps

- HTTP: `Transfer-Encoding` codes other than `chunked` (for example `gzip`) are not supported. No `Accept-Encoding`, so no compression.
- HTTP: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are not built. They move to after module 7, because browsers use them only over TLS. HTTP/3 also needs QUIC.
- HTTP: one idle connection for each server. No pool of several at once, no parallel requests.
- HTTP cache: no `Expires`, no heuristic freshness (both need HTTP date parsing), and no 301 caching.
- HTTP cache: a reply with a `Vary` header is not stored. No disk cache. No size limit. Module 10 needs a limit for memory accounting.
- HTTP: redirects only for GET. The cache is not split by top-level site, as Chrome does.
- URL: only `http://`. `https://` needs module 7.
- DNS: no short names from the `search` line of `/etc/resolv.conf`.
- DNS: no DNS-over-HTTPS. It needs module 7.
- Encoding: no UTF-16 and no other encodings. The meta scan is simple: it does not skip comments. The guess is not a real detector.
