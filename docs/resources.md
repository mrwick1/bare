# Resource use

This file records how much time and memory each part of the browser uses. Our priorities are speed, efficiency and low memory use. Update the tables when a module changes, and add a row for each new module.

## How to measure

Run `cargo run --release -p bare-bench`. It builds one page of 100,000 `<div>` and 100,000 `<span>` elements (5.2 MB), and one style sheet of 100,000 rules (6.9 MB), and runs each step five times.

- `ms` is the median time of the five runs.
- `peak MB` is the most heap memory alive at once during the step.
- `kept MB` is the heap memory that the result still holds, for example the DOM.
- A counting allocator measures the memory. It counts bytes that the program asks for, so it is lower than the RSS that `top` shows.

`cargo run --release -p bare-bench -- rss` runs a fresh process that only builds one DOM, and prints how much the real memory (RSS) of the process grew. The counting allocator does not see the overhead of `malloc` for each small allocation, so RSS is the higher and more honest number. Use RSS to compare with Chrome.

## bare, by module

| Module | Step                         | ms   | peak MB | kept MB | Note                                   |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | ---- | ------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1      | URL parse, 100,000 URLs      | 17   | 0.0     | 0.0     | about 170 ns for each URL              |
| 1      | URL join, 100,000 links      | 27   | 0.0     | 0.0     |                                        |
| 2      | Bytes to text                | 6    | 15.6    | 5.2     | one copy of the page                   |
| 2      | Tokenizer (streaming)        | 20   | 0.0     | 0.0     | counts 600,003 tokens, keeps none      |
| 2      | Tree builder (with tokenizer) | 45  | 23.1    | 17.8    | 400,006 nodes, 44 bytes each           |
| 3      | CSS tokenizer                | 36   | 0.0     | 0.0     | 6.9 MB, 2,500,000 tokens, 190 MB/s     |

Not measured:

- DNS, TCP and HTTP. They wait for the network, so a CPU benchmark says little. `parse_response` is private.
- The `bare` binary is 2.1 MB (release build).

History:

- 2026-10-29, first run: the tokenizer returned a `Vec` of all tokens (126 MB peak, 105 MB kept) and copied the page into a `Vec<char>`. The tree builder peaked at 135 MB for 67 MB kept.
- 2026-10-29, streaming tokenizer: the tokenizer reads the page text in place and gives one token at a time. The tree builder peak fell from 135 MB to 67 MB, and the tokenizer alone from 59 ms to 46 ms.
- 2026-10-29, small DOM: a `u32` `NodeId`, children as a linked list (no `Vec` for each node), and interned names. The tree builder peak fell from 67 MB to 37 MB, and the DOM kept from 67 MB to 30 MB (167 bytes to 74 bytes for each node). The spare room of the node list is given back at the end of `parse`.
- 2026-10-29, borrowed tokens: names, texts and attribute values are slices of the page, and the tokenizer scans runs of plain text without looking at each letter. The tokenizer went from 46 ms to 20 ms and the tree builder from 78 ms to 57 ms. Memory did not change: the strings were freed at once before.

- 2026-10-29, text buffer: all texts, attribute values, comments and doctypes live in one `String` of the `Document`, and all attributes in one `Vec`. A node holds a `Span` (8 bytes) and no `String`. A node is 36 bytes. The DOM kept fell from 30 MB to 18 MB, and the RSS of the DOM from 43 MB to 21 MB (112 bytes to 55 bytes for each node). The tree builder went from 57 ms to 45 ms.

What the numbers say:

- The arena is 36 bytes for each node (14 MB for 400,006 nodes). The rest is the attribute list (12 bytes for each attribute) and the text buffer.
- Real memory (RSS) for the DOM of this page: 21 MB, which is 55 bytes for each node. Chrome's DOM is about 22 MB for 200,005 elements (rough, see below), and that page has no text nodes between the tags. The two are close.
- The text buffer and the attribute list never shrink while the page lives. When JavaScript changes the DOM (module 9), we may need to clean them up.

## Chrome (Blink), the same page shape

Method: one fresh Chrome on a hyprcage screen for each page, with its own profile. The page is a local file. The script forces layout, waits 4 seconds, and reads the RSS of the page's renderer process (`ps`). One run for each page, so treat the numbers as rough.

| Page                                                            | Renderer RSS |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Blank page                                                      | 152 MB       |
| 200,005 elements, no style sheet (browser defaults only)        | 504 MB       |
| Same, with 107 class rules                                      | 543 MB       |
| Same rules, but `display: none` on the body (no style, no layout) | 174 MB       |

What the numbers say (hypothesis: the split cannot be separated more finely with RSS):

- Rules add about 39 MB (543 minus 504) for 200,000 elements. That is about 195 bytes for each element.
- Style and layout together add about 330 MB (504 minus 174), about 1.6 KB for each element. Layout objects are most of it.
- The DOM alone adds about 22 MB (174 minus 152). It is a rough figure, because the baseline varies between runs.
- The first reading of the no-style page was 1.06 GB. A repeat gave 504 MB. We do not know why the first one was high. We use the repeat.
- Chrome counts RSS here. The `bare` table counts heap bytes. Do not compare them as equal.
